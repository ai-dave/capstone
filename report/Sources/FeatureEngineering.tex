After converting contiguous nucleotide sequences into 6-mer words, \textit{Bag of N-grams} model was used to produce document vectors.


\subsection{n-grams}

We use \textit{CountVectorizer}\footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html}} to convert k-merized sequences to a matrix of 4-gram counts.
\autoref{fig:ngrams} above shows 4-gram phrases generated from a series of 6-mers of the original sequence. 
%
\subsection{Frequency Vectorization}
The frequencies of ordered 4-grams from each single nucleic acid k-merized sequence will produce a histogram based on the occurance of the 4-gram.
\autoref{fig:count-vector} above shows a Count Vector formed from 4-gram frequencies. Each Document Vector is a representation of a single nucleic acid sequence.

\subsection{Implementation}
Python code implementing \textit{CountVectorizer} and \textit{pickle}:
\begin{minted}{python}
cv = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(4,4), lowercase=False) # 4-word n-gram
X = cv.fit_transform(human_texts)
X_chimp = cv.transform(chimp_texts)
X_dog = cv.transform(dog_texts)

pickle.dump(cv, open('CountVectorizer-human.pkl','wb'))
\end{minted}
